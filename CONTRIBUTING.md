**Commit message format**

Each and every commit message must include a scope and a subject and your commit must be lowercase:

> `<scope>: subject`

The scope name is the effected filename without the extension, and the subject is details of your code changes / fixes. 

eg,

> `loonbot: your commit message here.`

> `lib/users: your commit message here.`
